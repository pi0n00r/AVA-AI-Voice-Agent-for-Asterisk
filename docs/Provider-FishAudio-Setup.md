# Fish Audio Provider Setup Guide

## Overview

[Fish Audio](https://fish.audio) is a text-to-speech service built on the S1/S2
speech models, with a large public voice library and voice cloning. It is a
pipeline TTS adapter in AVA: pair it with any STT and LLM provider.

It suits telephony for one specific reason: the API returns **raw PCM at a sample
rate you choose**, streamed over a chunked HTTP response. AVA asks for the call's
own rate, so an 8 kHz call is synthesised at 8 kHz, converted to µ-law chunk by
chunk, and played while the sentence is still being generated — no intermediate
resample, no waiting for the full sentence.

| | |
|---|---|
| Capability | TTS (pipeline adapter) |
| Provider key | `fishaudio_tts` |
| Models | `s1`, `s2-pro`, `s2.1-pro` (default), `drama-3-preview`, `s2.1-pro-free` (no API credit needed, for testing) |
| Output used | `pcm` (streamed) or `wav` (buffered) |
| Pricing | Usage is measured in UTF-8 text bytes; see [Fish Audio developers](https://fish.audio/developers/) for current rates |
| Per-agent voice | Not applicable (modular adapter); the voice is set on the provider or pipeline |

## Quick Start

### 1. Get an API key

1. Create an account on [fish.audio](https://fish.audio).
2. Open the API keys page and create a key.
3. Browse the voice library and copy the id of the voice you want. That id is
   the required `reference_id` below.

### 2. Configure the environment variable

```bash
# .env
FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY=your-api-key
FISH_AUDIO_REFERENCE_ID=voice-model-id # legacy env-only configuration
```

You can also add or edit a Fish Audio TTS provider under **Providers** in the
Admin UI, save it, then upload a provider-scoped API key. Managed keys are stored
in owner-only files and are not written into YAML. **Test Connection** performs
a short synthesis with the configured model and reference voice, so invalid
keys, unavailable models, missing developer credit, and empty audio responses
are detected before a call.

The model field is a closed dropdown populated from AAVA's checked-in Fish Audio
model catalog. CI keeps that catalog synchronized with the runtime default,
sample configuration, and provider documentation. An older custom model remains
visible while editing an existing provider, but must be replaced with a listed
model before it can be selected again.

The adapter is not registered when the key or `reference_id` is missing. A
pipeline referencing it is rejected at startup; AVA does not silently switch to
another provider or voice.

### 3. Configure the provider

```yaml
providers:
  fishaudio_tts:
    type: fishaudio
    capabilities:
      - tts
    enabled: true
    model: s2.1-pro        # also: s1, s2-pro, s2.1-pro-free, drama-3-preview
    reference_id: voice-model-id # required voice id from your Fish Audio library
    audio_format: pcm      # pcm (streamed) or wav (buffered)
    sample_rate: null      # null follows the call: 8 kHz telephony, 16 kHz wideband
    transport: http        # http, or websocket for the realtime session
    latency: low           # low, normal, balanced
    chunk_length: 200      # 100-300, provider-side synthesis granularity
    normalize: true
    temperature: 0.7
    top_p: 0.7
    speed: null            # prosody.speed override
    volume: null           # prosody.volume override
    connect_timeout_sec: 10 # connection establishment/pool wait
    read_timeout_sec: 30    # maximum gap between streamed chunks
    output_resampler: inherit
```

`latency: low` favours time to first audio, which is what a phone call needs.
Leave `sample_rate` at `null` unless you have a reason to force a rate: a rate
Fish Audio cannot emit for PCM/WAV (anything outside 8, 16, 24, 32 and 44.1 kHz) falls
back to 16 kHz and is resampled locally.

Remote HTTP endpoints must use HTTPS, and remote realtime endpoints must use
WSS. Plain HTTP/WS is accepted only for an explicit loopback host so the bundled
mock can run without sending a bearer key over the network.

### 4. Configure a pipeline

```yaml
pipelines:
  hybrid_fishaudio:
    stt: local_stt
    llm: openai_llm
    tts: fishaudio_tts
    options:
      tts:
        format:
          encoding: mulaw
          sample_rate: 8000
```

Every provider key can also be overridden per pipeline under `options.tts`, and
per request at runtime (useful to switch voice mid-call).

### 5. Test a call

```bash
agent check
docker compose restart ai_engine
```

Place a call into the pipeline and watch the engine log:

```
Fish Audio TTS synthesis started   call_id=... model=s2.1-pro source_sample_rate=8000
Fish Audio TTS synthesis completed call_id=... first_audio_ms=210 output_bytes=27040
```

`first_audio_ms` is the time from the request to the first audio chunk handed to
the transport: that is the number to watch when tuning `latency` and
`chunk_length`.

## Testing without an account

`scripts/fish_audio_mock.py` answers like the service does — Bearer auth, the
`model` header, body and sample-rate validation, chunked audio — so the whole
path can be exercised, including a real call:

```bash
python scripts/fish_audio_mock.py &

# unit tests
pytest tests/test_pipeline_fish_audio_adapters.py

# same integration test, against the mock instead of the service
FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY=mock-key FISH_AUDIO_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8788/v1 \
    pytest -m integration tests/test_pipeline_fish_audio_adapters.py
```

To route an actual call through it, set `base_url: http://127.0.0.1:8788/v1` on
the provider. The mock serves a generated tone by default; point
`FISH_MOCK_LOCAL_WS=ws://127.0.0.1:8765` at a local AI server to hear speech
instead. Three hooks in the request text exercise failure handling:
`FISH_MOCK_401`, `FISH_MOCK_SLOW` and `FISH_MOCK_EMPTY`.

## Realtime transport (websocket)

Fish Audio also exposes a realtime endpoint, `wss://api.fish.audio/v1/tts/live`,
which keeps one session open and accepts text as it is written. With
`transport: websocket` the adapter opens that session for a whole turn and sends
each fragment as the engine produces it, so the provider starts speaking while
the model is still composing the rest — and the engine no longer waits for a
fragment to be synthesised before consuming the next tokens.

```yaml
providers:
  fishaudio_tts:
    transport: websocket
    # ws_base_url: wss://api.fish.audio/v1   # defaults to base_url with a ws scheme
```

Requirements and behaviour:

- `msgpack` (already in `requirements.txt`) — the realtime protocol is
  MessagePack. It is imported only when the websocket transport is used.
- The engine feeds text progressively only for adapters that declare
  `supports_text_stream`; with `transport: http` the same adapter keeps the
  one-request-per-fragment path, so nothing else changes.
- A superseded turn (barge-in, a newer transcript) cancels the session; the
  provider sees the socket close, which is expected.
- The session log lines are `Fish Audio realtime session opening` and
  `... completed`, with `fragments`, `first_audio_ms` and `output_bytes`.

Test it against the mock, which serves the realtime endpoint too:

```bash
python scripts/fish_audio_mock.py &     # HTTP on 8788, realtime on 8789
FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY=mock-key FISH_AUDIO_WS_BASE_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:8789/v1 \
    pytest -m integration tests/test_pipeline_fish_audio_adapters.py
```

## Checking against the live service for free

The `s2.1-pro-free` model answers without API credit, so both endpoints can
be exercised at no cost:

```bash
FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY=... FISH_AUDIO_MODEL=s2.1-pro-free \
    FISH_AUDIO_REFERENCE_ID=<a voice id from the library> \
    pytest -m integration tests/test_pipeline_fish_audio_adapters.py
```

Worth knowing before you top up: API credit is billed separately from the
platform credit shown in the web app. An account with platform credits but no
developer balance gets `402 Payment Required` from the paid models, and the
realtime endpoint refuses the websocket handshake with the same status.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| `Fish Audio TTS requires an API key` | `FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY` is unset, or the provider block has an empty `api_key`. |
| Pipeline resolves to a placeholder adapter | Same cause, or `enabled: false`. The startup log says `Fish Audio TTS pipeline adapter not registered`. |
| HTTP 401 in the engine log | Key rejected by the service; check it has TTS access and remaining credit. |
| HTTP 402 / quota errors | The selected model needs developer credit or an entitlement the account does not have. Add credit or select a model available to the account. |
| HTTP 422 `unsupported sample_rate` | Something forced a rate the service does not emit. Leave `sample_rate: null`. |
| `Unsupported Fish Audio TTS output format` | `audio_format` must be `pcm` or `wav`; mp3 and opus are not used for calls. |
| Audio plays but sounds thin or metallic | Check the transport encoding and rate in `options.tts.format`; on 8 kHz telephony the adapter should report `source_sample_rate=8000` (no resample). |
| First audio is slow | Try `latency: low` and a smaller `chunk_length`; check network latency to the API, and confirm the greeting is not synthesised on the caller's first turn. |
| Turn fails while connecting | The connection budget (`connect_timeout_sec`) elapsed. |
| Turn fails after an audio gap | No HTTP chunk or realtime WebSocket event arrived within `read_timeout_sec`; healthy long streams can exceed this value in total. |
| `Fish Audio TTS returned no audio` | The service completed without an audio payload. The current synthesis fails instead of silently playing an empty response; check the account, model, voice id, and request text. |
| `realtime transport requires msgpack` | Install `msgpack` (it ships in `requirements.txt`) or switch back to `transport: http`. |
